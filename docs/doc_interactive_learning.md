### Creating Robust React Applications with Redux
The source code [example](https://github.com/shaunwa/redux-todos-example)

Some ideas :
 - react-persist to keep state in local storage for example
 - reselect for selectors
 - react-testing library
 - Context and useReducer instead of redux library?
