## Naming

Names should:

- be understandable
- not confound readers
- be short in short scope
- be readable (not shortened) in long scope

## Design Patterns

A design pattern is a named solution to a problem in a given context.

One of the primary goals of software development is independent deployability.

Dependency management helps achieve this goal.
