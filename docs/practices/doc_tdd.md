## Summary

To review (TDD by example by Kent Beck):

- Red/Green/Refactor cycle
- Test first (Red)
- When implementing
  - "Dumb"/"Quick" implementation
  - Obvious implementation
  - Triangulation
- When test passes (Green)
  - Remove duplication (Refactor)
- Todolist tasks
- Small steps when not sure
- Larger steps when confident or obvious
- Tests should show intent
- Refactor code and tests
- Emergent design

TDD done right should help:

- reduce debugging time
- produce reliable documentation from written tests
- improve code design (decoupling...)
- refactor code confidently (suite tests acts as a parachute)
