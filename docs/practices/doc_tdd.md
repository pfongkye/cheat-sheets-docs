## Summary

To review (TDD by example by Kent Beck):

    - Red/Green/Refactor cycle

    - Test first (Red)

    - When implementing

        - "Dumb"/"Quick" implementation

        - Obvious implementation

        - Triangulation

    - When test passes (Green)

        - Remove duplication (Refactor)

    - Todolist tasks

    - Small steps when not sure

    - Larger steps when confident or obvious

    - Tests should show intent

    - Refactor code and tests

    - Emergent design
